## Project Proposal

Provide analysis of top 10 companies in 2017 as determined by Fortune Magazine. 

## Finding Data

We decided to use data.world source for target companies. Then Alpha Advatange to pull current stock values. 

* [data.world](https://data.world/)
* https://data.world/chasewillden/fortune-500-companies-2017

* [Alpha Advantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)


## Data Cleanup & Analysis


*  Fortune 500 Top 500 of 2017 CSV from data.world

*  Convert CSV into MySQL database to filter into top 100 and top 10. Also calculate average, min, & max for profits and     revenue. 

*  New CSV files created from MySQL to create tables and bar graphs for top 10 companies. 

* New CSV files also used to create JSON to input into FLASK search.
